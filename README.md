# DrosoChilla

This is the GitHub page for the work-in-progress DrosoChilla, developed by Edridge D'Souza under Dr. Michele Markstein at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. It is an inexpensive Raspberry Pi based temperature and humidity monitoring system. Our aim is to allow researchers to monitor their research environments remotely under an open-source, inexpensive framework.
